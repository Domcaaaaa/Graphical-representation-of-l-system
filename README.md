# L-System Turtle Graphics

This Python script generates fractal patterns using L-systems and visualizes them with the `turtle` graphics library. L-systems are mathematical models that define rules for recursively creating complex patterns, often used to simulate natural phenomena like tree structures and fractals.

## Overview
This script allows you to visualize different L-systems using the turtle graphics library. It provides several predefined fractal patterns and allows users to create custom ones by inputting their own axiom and transformation rules.

### Features
- Predefined fractal patterns such as Koch curves and tree structures.
- Support for custom fractals with user-defined axiom, rule, angle, and iterations.
- Real-time rendering using the turtle graphics library.
- Interactive features, including the ability to quit by pressing 'q'.

## Installation
To run this script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You also need the `turtle` library, which is included with the standard Python distribution.

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the script** using Python:
   ```bash
   python lsystemtoturtle.py
